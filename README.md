 An immune landscape across multiple ancestries

**Abstract:**
The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) alleles, locate in the human chromosomal 6p21.3 region, play pivotal roles in immune function and disease susceptibility. While the features of human leukocyte antigens (HLA) alleles have been increasingly explored, the extent of their quantification divergence remain insufficiently understood. In this study, we elucidated a comprehensive immune spectrum of classical HLA-I polygenic divergence across multiple ancestries spanning 28,373 samples from 20 published datasets and one in-house cohorts. Our findings revealed significant variations in HLA-I allele frequencies and domain HLA-I alleles across diverse populations. Additionally, some HLA regions were especially conservative among worldwide individuals. The evolutionary divergence patterns highlighted distinct genetic adaptations across 5 multiple ancestries and 27 subpopulations. The germline HLA divergences were independent from trained adaptive immunities. By integrating innate immunity driven by germline HLA divergence and adaptive immunity reflected in blood lymphocyte compositions, we identified distinct immune characteristics of 3 population stratifications. Collectively, our findings stress the essential role of canonical HLA-I regions in shaping human immunity and elucidate the communications between HLA divergence and adaptive immune cells, providing valuable insights into population-specific immune landscapes.
