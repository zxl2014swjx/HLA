An immune landscape across multiple ancestries

**Abstract:**
The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) alleles, located in the human genome on chromosome 6p21.3, play pivotal roles in immune function and disease susceptibility. While the features of human leukocyte antigens (HLA) alleles have been increasingly explored, the extent of their quantification divergence remains insufficiently understood. In this study, we elucidated a comprehensive immune spectrum of classical HLA-I polymorphic divergence across multiple ancestries spanning 42,520 samples from 22 published datasets and 2 in-house cohorts. Our findings revealed significant variations about HLA-I allele frequencies and domain HLA-I alleles across diverse populations. Additionally, some HLA regions were especially conservative among worldwide individuals. The evolutionary divergence patterns highlighted distinct genetic adaptations across 5 ancestries and 29 sub-populations. By integrating innate immunity driven by germline HLA divergence and adaptive immunity reflected in blood lymphocyte compositions, we explored distinct characteristics of human immune systems. Collectively, our findings stressed the essential roles of canonical HLA-I regions about human immunity and elucidated the communications between HLA divergence and adaptive immune cells, providing valuable insights into population-specific immune landscapes.
