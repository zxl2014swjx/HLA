A comprehensive innate and adaptive immune landscape

**Abstract:**
The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) alleles located in human chromosomal 6p21.3 region play pivotal roles in immunity and disease. While their characterizations are increasingly explored, the divergence and quantization of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) loci remain poorly understood. Our work elucidated a comprehensive immune spectrum of multiple ancestries HLA-I polygenic divergence by analyzing 28,373 samples from 20 published cohorts and 1 in-house dataset. We observed significant variations in HLA-I allele frequencies across different populations, which were associated with certain immune-related diseases. The 5 major ancestries and 27 sub-populations of involved individuals revealed different evolutionary directions. The immune spectrum, which integrated innate immunity driven by germline HLA divergence and adaptive immunity reflected in blood lymphocyte compositions, we identified unique immune capabilities across three population stratifications. Taken together, our findings underscore the essential role of classical HLA-I regions in human immunity, demonstrating how the interplay between HLA divergence and adaptive immune cells shapes immune properties. Moreover, disease susceptibility and aging patterns varied across different population stratifications.
